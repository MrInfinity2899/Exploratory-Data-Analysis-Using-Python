# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
This repository showcases a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow using Python, applying essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It reflects my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data — a fundamental step in the data science lifecycle.

The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis

Feature engineering and correlation analysis

Interactive and static visualizations to highlight trends, patterns, and anomalies

I have structured the notebooks and scripts to be clear, modular, and reproducible — with a focus on communicating findings effectively through both code and visual storytelling.

This repository is a demonstration of my hands-on skills in:

Data wrangling and transformation

Analytical thinking and pattern recognition

Visual communication and statistical interpretation

As someone actively seeking a role in Data Science, this project represents not just technical proficiency but also a strong emphasis on practical, real-world data problem solving.

I welcome feedback and collaboration, and I’m excited to bring these skills into a professional environment where data drives innovation and impact.
